        <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
        <p>This page illustrates how you can write proper <b>HTML </b> using only a text editor,<br>
        such as Windows Notepad. You can also download a free text editor, such as<br>
         Crimson Editor, which is better than Notepad.</p>
         <br>
        <p>There is a small graphic after the period at the end of this sentence.<img src="https://up.yimg.com/ib/th?id=OIP.f_Sl3hlKLNuS4iGjVPq8ygHaE8&pid=Api&rs=1&c=1&qlt=95&w=166&h=110" height ="30px"width ="30px">The<br>
        graphic is in a file. The file is inside a folder named "images."</p>

        <p>Link:<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a><br>
         Another link:<a href="https://github.com/">Another Web page</a><br>
         Note the way the <b>BR</b> tag works in the two lines above.
